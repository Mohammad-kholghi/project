### Milestone Report:


###  Contribution:
*Mohammad*: Everything


### A list of tasks that you have completed:
- Cloning ghsot (about 10 times)
- Reading the whole Ghost documentation
- installing every tool on the server (like docker and yarn and ....)
- building and testing the project
- finally finishing the job


### Documenting your experience as you learn how to setup your pipeline
- I learned about IaC a lot, and it was kinda fun.
- Also about github, the issue form was something I had never worked with.
- Learning about `.yml` files, and building a new tool. I needed it so much in my day to day life.
- My experience was both good and bad. Good because Ghost was new, bad because there were a lot of bothering bugs that I had no idea of. I still had them till the end of the project, and they did not solve.
- Another experience was that I encountered some new uniqe problems that I think no other team had. My SSD burnt, my teammate's laptop screen burnt, she deleted the course and I was left with a whole project, my job that is growing and needs a lot of time and energy, ... . And now I am sooo bothered and mentally tired.
